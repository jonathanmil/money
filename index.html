  			To begin I would like to save 200$ of the 1200$ on gas. If any of the money is leftover I will likely save it for the next week incase I need more money to spend in the future. My car is 15mpg which means for me to travel it will be very difficult without a large sum of money.

  			The second thing that I would like to purchas is food, in order for me to survive the quarentine I will need to have enough food at my house. I will likely head over to costco and purchase four

  			With all of these purchases I will total up 349.76$. If i were to be living at home I would end up losing this money to pay for insurance and rent however because I am living at home this will give me to options. To save that money and invest it into the depleting stock market or to invest into recreational things that I may want such as video games and a new phone(I will need to save up for that as 1200$ for all of those things is to much.)
