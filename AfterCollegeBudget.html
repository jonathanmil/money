After graduating college with a computer science degree I will likely move to Texas. With lower taxes and a far cheaper cost of living it is something that I believe would be much better for me financially. I will likely get a entry level job as a programmer with a average startings salary of 
		<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/houston-entry-level-programmer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,7_IM394_KO8,30.htm">
			60k$ a year.
		</a>
		<br><br><br>
With this salary I will need to put aside 
		<a href="https://goodcalculators.com/us-salary-tax-calculator/texas/60000/">
			11k total
		</a>
		<br><br><br>
		Now with the 49k that I have leftover I will have to put aside 6096$ a year on health insurance and another 2400$ for medical insurance. I will also need to put 3216$ off for car insurance. Thankfully I already own a car so I will not need to pay for a car. I will also Set 
		aside 2400$ a year for gas. I will also have to be paying 3600$ a year to student loan debt to eventually pay it off. With all of these things totalled up I will be left with 31,288$ for food, rent and investment. 
		<br><br><br>
		I will be investing 200$ a month into a savings bankaccount and another 300$ a month into a savings account for a morgage. I will also be placing 2000$ from my salary into the stock market into a company that I believe will do well. With all of this totalled up I will be left
		with 23,288 on food, rent and things I enjoy. I will also need to subtract 180$ for a yearly gym membership. I will be renting out a two room house for 12000$ a year. With the rest of my money I will be using it on food and things I enjoy because happyness is something that is 
		needed in life.

		With all of these things I will be able to both be setup for the future while also being able to live a life that is great. I will sacrifice purchasing a new car and a great house by instead saving money for a time in the future when money will be 
		very important to me. If people had all been saving money then they would be able to purchase produce in this dark time.
