After graduating college with a computer science degree I will likely move to Texas. With lower taxes and a far cheaper cost of living it is something that I believe would be much better for me financially. I will likely get a entry level job as a programmer with a average startings salary of 
		<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/houston-entry-level-programmer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,7_IM394_KO8,30.htm">
			60k$ a year.
		</a>
With this salary I will need to put aside 
		<a href="https://goodcalculators.com/us-salary-tax-calculator/texas/60000/">
			11k total
		</a>
		Now with the 49k that I have leftover I will have to put aside 6096$ a year on health insurance and another 2400$ for medical insurance. I will also need to put 3216$ off for car insurance. Thankfully I already own a car so I will not need to pay for a car. I will also Set 
		aside 2400$ a year for gas. I will also have to be paying 3600$ a year to student loan debt to eventually pay it off. With all of these things totalled up I will be left with 31,288$ for food, rent and investment. 
		<br> 
		I will be investing 200$ a month into a savings bankaccount and another 300$ a month into a savings account for a morgage. I will also be placing 2000$ from my salary into the stock market into a company that I believe will do well. With all of this totalled up I will be left
		with 23,288 on food, rent and things I enjoy. I will also need to subtract 180$ for a yearly gym membership. I will be renting out a two room house for 12000$ a year. With the rest of my money I will be using it on food and things I enjoy because happyness is something that is 
		needed in life.
